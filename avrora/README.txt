Just run the Makefile, using make command.
The make command assumes that there is a bin/ directory already in place.

Once the make command has completed successfully, run the makejar.bash script file as follows:

$ sh makejar.bash 113

The 113 is the avrora version file.

The jar file will be in the jars/ directory.
